# IR-Spectra-Prediction-Graph-Models

Original Dataset can be obtained from https://drive.google.com/file/d/13tNHMeimUCIQSmub-wD-23hIDZFSwxlM/view?usp=sharing

Dataset can  be scraped by running 1) NIST Spectra Scraper.py, 2) NIST Preprocessor.ipynb, and 3) NIST Molecule Selector.ipynb in order. 

Model training can be run directly on Google Colab using the Spectra_Predictor_GColab.ipynb file and the dataset file linked above.
